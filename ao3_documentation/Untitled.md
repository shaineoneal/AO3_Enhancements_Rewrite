Kent: Hey.

Indigo: Hey, how's it going?

Kent: Good. How was your day?

Indigo: Oh, long.
  I'm playing, uh, I'm playing IT today.
  No.

Kent: The very thing you didn't want to do.

Indigo: It's fine. I'm getting paid for it.
  
Kent: Well, there you go.
  But you always said, I don't want to be an IT guy.
  Yeah.
  Yeah.
  Well, you got to start somewhere.
  Speaking of IT guy, I'm at the mic Jan downtown yesterday.
  Um, he's, uh, he's the special problem guy.
  Um,
  Do what?
  Downtown Greenville, like, IT and technology?
  Yes.
  Oh, cool. Good for him.
  Yeah, he's got...
  I don't know if there's anything overlapped between what he needs
  or what we provide.
  Yeah.
  You know, there might be, but, but kind of ones and twosies.
  I don't know how to sort of things.
  So, anyway.
  So, alright.
But, I appreciate you calling.
And I think it's better than just trying to solve a meeting time
on text.
It's definitely more efficient.
Yeah.
And it's just good to hear each other.
And then, then, then just work, you know, yeah.
Um, so I still would like to try.
There it is like a limited lunch or something like that.
I know that's not much time, but not that we don't think we need.
Hours or anything.
We just, I mean, I like we did last week.
Just, just meet up and.
And be with each other for a little bit.
So, what do you, what do you think about that?

Indigo: Yeah. Um, I would love to get lunch.
    Um, my one thing is I can't imagine we're not going to talk about like the video I sent on Friday at lunch.

Kent: Yeah.
        
Indigo: And I mean, as I said in the text, I'm not really comfortable talking about that in person without Shaine there.
  
Kent: But, I just want to hear, I want to hear from you and your story.

Indigo: You're, you're going to hear from me and my story. Like, if not, I heard it all.
    I just don't like being in the spotlight by myself.

Kent: It's not a spotlight.
It's, it's.
I, there might be things I'm going to say to you that are not privy to anybody else.
Like what?
I just, I want to hug you.
I want to love you.
I want to hear from you.
I've got no plan to argue or to attack.
I have compassion for you.
And I want to, I just want to hear from you.
And I want to, I want to talk to you.
I just, I don't know.
Every time I've tried to have this kind of conversation with y'all, like, like, for example, in 2019 or maybe 2018.
Um, I don't know.
It's just.
It's hard when I'm trying to, I guess, defend my position to someone who I know, like, at his core, opposes it.
Um, I don't want you to.
Please hear me.
I'm not asking, I'm not asking you to defend your position.
I want to hear your story.
I want to hear what we've missed.
I want to hear what you've gone through.
I want to hear the difficulty you face.
I want to hear your pain.
I don't know how to say any other way that.
I just won't.
I'm your dad.
I just, I just want to share a compassion with you.
How about that?
That means a lot to me.
Um, I do.
And that, I mean, that is, that's, that's, I just, I just want to share a time together.
You know, um, that's.
That's all, that's all a mask in you know, and, and, and if you, I mean, if you'd make you feel better to drive and be there.
So you're not captive to my car.
I'll do that.
You know, I mean, whatever, whatever helps you feel like it's, it's, it's good.
I just want to look in your eyes and hear it from you.
You know, I want, I want to touch you.
I want to, I want to hug you.
I definitely want to hug you right now.
You know, I just.
I just want to hug you.
It's honestly.
I, I've got no, this, it's anything.
I was going to say no different compassion or love for you than I had when we met last week.
If anything is greater.
I.
And, and I just want you to trust that.
I want you to, I just want you to trust me.
I want you to trust me.
I just want you to trust me.

I just want you to trust me.
I just want you to trust me.
I just want you to trust me.
Indigo: I'm not comfortable talking about this specific subject without Shaine here.
    For the first time with you.
    Like, I mean, even after one time, I don't care.
    I just have never opened up like this to anybody in my family before.

Kent: Sure. Then it's time. It's time to have that discussion.
  
Indigo: I'm trying to. I'm saying I can't without like somebody there.
And I think you can.
I think you can.
I know you will enough to know that I believe you could.
And I don't think you need to lean on Shaine or anybody else for that.
I don't think you need to lean on shame or anybody else for that.
I don't think you need to lean on shame or anybody else for that.
I don't think you need to lean on shame or anybody else for that.
I don't think you need to lean on shame or anybody else for that.
I don't think you need to lean on shame or anybody else for that.
I don't think you need to lean on shame or anybody else for that.
I don't think you need to lean on shame or anybody else for that.
I don't think you need to lean on shame or anybody else for that.
I don't think you need to lean on shame or anybody else for that.
I don't think you need to lean on shame or anybody else for that.
I don't think you need to lean on shame or anybody else for that.
Indigo: If you don't need to be fully honest, my therapist thinks it would be a better idea of shame with it.
    Like, I have a medical professional told me that would be a good idea.
    I don't, I don't mean anything.
    And that wasn't, that wasn't her idea, by the way.
    I floated to that.
    I said, "Hey, what if Shaine came to lunch with me and my dad?"
    And my therapist was like, "that's a great idea."

I just, and I'm asking you for me and you, I mean, that's all, that's all I'm asking.
It's just me and you, and you know, medical professionals, other people aside, you and I can't have a discussion about what's going on in your heart.
You know, it's, it's, Shaine can't answer any question about what's going on in your heart, but you can't.
I don't want to hear from Shaine.
Indigo: You're not going to hear from Shaine.

I feel, if you ask me a question about what's going on in my heart, there are years upon years of knowing you don't support what's going on in my heart.
Well, like in the way of me in answering and having a helping hand in bringing that answer out is not the same thing as Shaine telling you the answers.
I would love to discuss this with you. I would love to be open with it. I am just not comfortable doing it for the first time alone.
Indigo: I'm intimidated to talk to you about this because...

Kent: I don't... please don't be intimidated.

Indigo: Dad, you follow people on Twitter that say all trans people should be put in jail.
I've never, I've never looked.
Okay. Following is very different from agreeing. I followed tons of people I agree and disagree with.
Regardless, it means this is the media that you choose to take in. And it's just, it's scary to me knowing that there's somebody who takes in this media that I'm about to open up in trial.
Yes.
I don't want to hurt you, son. I want to love you. I just, I don't want to hurt you with you.
I'm, I, we've met many times to, to, to maybe argue and push through issues.
I don't want to do that. I'm, I'm honestly exhausted with that.
And if I can't meet with you just to express my love for you, then what I thought we had as a parent trial relation, I just don't know.
I mean, I'm, I'm dumbfounded. I understand your pain. I mean, I understand that you're, you've had pain in years of it.
And I look, I just want to hear it. And even if you can't get it out, fine.
I'm not saying, hey, do you need a car or a glass of wine or a glass of wine?
I'm not saying, hey, do you need a car or a glass of wine?
I'm not saying, hey, do you need a car or a glass of wine?
Okay, that's enough for today. I, I'm not here to demand anything from you at this point.
And, and I'll, you can look at things I do on Twitter. I'm not going to judge you by things that, that you follow on whatever you, I don't know what your needs are, but whatever.
I don't really use the time of social media.
I'm just saying, I, dude, I've followed Trump supporters. Well, I saw a thing here the day that when, when Trump, you know, when I voted, I said, well, the deal is done.
God help us.
Because I never thought Trump was the guy that I followed. Trump people.
I thought Trump, they said a lot of stuff. It is not the best guy to the presidency, but I fall because I'm not a single person.
I don't know if anybody ever said, you know, put all trans people in jail. I would never like that.
I mean, I would be like, okay, that's kind of dumb.
Yeah. I don't, I don't know.
If you saw me following people on Twitter that say, like, all Christians should be put the death or in jail, what would, what would you think? Would that intimidate or scare you?
If you're following the person, it would not bother me.
Okay.
We don't, we don't live in an echo chamber. I follow people who are on Christian, who are, who are against God, who, I'm just saying the media you take in affects the way you think regardless of whether you like the tweets or not.
And I don't, I don't take in everything that I follow.
You take in everything you see every second of every day.
I'm everything I follow. I'm not here we are.
Okay. I mean, not going to have an argument with you. You're drawing me into that and I don't want that.
I love you. I want to meet with you. I am open for launch tomorrow.
I'm open for dinner. I'm going to first basketball game Friday night. I will for no that to meet with you. You just let me know.
And, and I just have to be me and you. And if you're uncomfortable at any point.
Okay.
I'm just saying if you want to know my story and love me for me and all of that.
I need somebody to be there backing me up when I'm sharing my story with you.
If you want to love me for who you think I am, then I'm down to do whatever any time.
I have fun hanging out with you. But if you want to know my story and understand what I feel, I'm just I can't share that alone.
Okay. Okay. All right.
Well, I just don't know how to respond to that. I mean, the three of us again once this weekend.
I don't think that is the plan because I'm not interested. I just I don't want a third party there. I don't think you and I need a third party there.
And to say that means the relationship I thought we had is not even there. If you and I can't talk and even broach a subject without you having someone to support you, I just don't know.
If that's how you feel when I can't change that. But.
So my heart is broken not only for what's happening to our relationship that I see right now, but for what has happened to you.
And I want to hug you, man. I just hang it.
Well, my offer to lunch tomorrow and Friday still stay inside of the end of the game Sunday. I'm going to be a church.
Okay.
No, it's I don't.
If you feel feel meet with me to discuss as much or as little as you're comfortable.
You know, you don't even have to say anything that makes you feel uncomfortable.
You know, you just.
I don't know. I so desperately. I so desperately want to open my heart and share this with you.
Share a little bit. Share a little bit. I just started when I was the same.
I can share a little bit right now while we're discussing. I can share.
Do you not understand that I want to see your face to face? I don't want to talk to you on the phone.
Okay. All right.
We're having Thanksgiving. If you want to come, it's going to be a Jimmy and Beth in Columbia.
I don't I guess Thanksgiving day. I don't leave another time for that.
And sometimes after that, we'll be doing Christmas with the family.
It a grandma's house. They're all coming to the TR.
I don't want to get in on the day. I want to share that with you.
And I'm just I'm open to the lunch and she just want to get together and not even bring it up.
Then that's fine. That's fine.
I mean, this is a genuine question. Are either of us capable of handling a relationship without discussing the elephant in the room first?
I think you'd be surprised what I've already done.
I didn't like ignoring the elephant in the room. And if there's an elephant in the room that you'd like to discuss, I would absolutely love to.
But I just I want to have a parent child close relationship with you, but I can't do that knowing that you don't know the full story.
And that's why I sent you all the video last weekend instead of just I don't know not even trying is because I want to share my life with you all.
But there has to be a starting point.
I think it's a continuation point. I mean, we're all on this journey. Right. And it's just a revelation along the journey.
Yeah. Yeah. I don't know.
If you're saying the requirement for us to have an ongoing relationship with you is to have a being with somebody else, I just I don't I don't think that needs to happen.
If you're saying you can't have a relationship with me because you don't want to get in love with me and shame, then I don't understand that.
I'm trying to I'm trying to tell you a situation in which I'd be comfortable sharing my story and you're saying no, I don't want to.
You're saying that you'll only do it on your terms without even considering money.
No, no, no, no, no, I totally we've always met face to face. We've always met person to person.
And if any point in past you had said, hey, can't before, before dad before I share you with you these these.
I don't know.
The electrical.
Rebottle. I need somebody with me. I just said what? I don't want to hear from you.
I just.
Shaine can sit there. And if she says a single word, she can walk out the door and go home. You will hear from me. I just.
I need that support with me. I.
Indigo: I don't know how to get across the feeling that I have of. I mean, not to use a biblical analogy, but I feel like I'm David talking to Goliath here.
  I mean, you've got the entire family and everybody else who believes the same thing as you do. And I'm not here at the black sheep.
  I just want another black sheep to sit beside me while I talk. That's literally it. I just.
Kent: I don't know. Number one, you are not a black sheep in her family. You're my child. Okay.
  I reject that analogy. Okay. I said what's about you are not. I mean, that whole fault that you're a black sheep.
  There is nobody in this world that loves you as much as your family. And who.
  Who loves you and has compassion for you, even when you go in ways that we.
  You know for so many guests, but that doesn't change our love for you.
  I can't imagine that that's true in every circle of life. If you just change and become a person, this opposite of the people that you're around, that love and compassion remains and walks with you.
  Your family loans for a greater relationship with you.
  Your sisters are wet. Not like in the last three days or weeks or more.
  But at years about where is Charlie? I'm like we just we just love him in giving room because it's clear that you're not around us.
  But we love you nonetheless. And we have not turned away from you. We do feel it's just just honesty that you've turned away from us.
  You don't want to be around us. It's clear that that it seems to be the case because we invite you and we ask you we invite both of you and ask you and it's, you know, it's pleased to ever think you're the black sheep.
  You've had more lifeline thrown to you and I don't know what we don't know what more to do.
  I just say I mean with my my my my my my my my son. I just want to meet with you.
  Okay, the things to do or to not say that past sentence, but also I desire a relationship with you all I want to love you all and I want to spend time with you all the reason why I've been with throwing is it's painful to be around anybody who doesn't know my story and respect who I am.
  So our options are you call me the name of prefer to be called or we the three of us sit down and talk about it.
  And and I share my story and we get on the same page.
  There's nothing I am trying to have nothing but grace flows from me.
  I need grace to flow to me as well because I've called you a name and you've been this to me for 23 years.
  It's hard to slip on the dime. Okay.
  Well, will you try to flip or if that's something you're not going to do this is what I want to talk to you in person about and I'm saying I can't talk about stuff that concerns.
  I don't know.
  It's hard to see my dad crying person. It's hard to see us both have such struggles sitting across the table from each other and I'm a push over and I will just shut up and say it's fine to make it to make you stop crying.
  But I want us to know each other's stories I want to be open.
  Then the number one is not to cry.
  I mean, okay.
  I'm out of promise.
  If you don't trust me that I can make that available.
  I just I don't I don't know.
  I don't know where to go.
  I don't know why you can't trust that I have that I would feel more comfortable sharing my story with you with somebody else that honestly because it is it is an imposing on the things that I might want to freely say.
  What is something that you could say that Shaine couldn't hear I can't think of a single thing.
  There's nothing there's nothing that I couldn't say to you with her there.
  I don't know.
  You're not listening to me.
  That's just.
  You're not listening to me.
  Sorry.
  Indigo.
  Whatever.
  You're not listening to me.
  I mean, how can.
  I just want to come to to me on this and you're bringing something new into it.
  I'm saying, what's just me the way we have.
  We can't meet the way we have because this whole situation is new.
  The whole topic is new.
  The whole everything is new.
  Last week last Sunday a week ago Grace called us boiling her eyes out and shared with us.
  And I said, and you know what I met with you anyway.
  And I didn't bring it up because I wanted you to be able to bring it up in your own time because I love you.
  And when you didn't bring it up, I saw it's just not ready.
  And I didn't push you.
  And I didn't.
  And I'm not going to.
  And if you said one thing about it, I would have listened.
  I was prepared to listen and love.
  Not a thing would have changed.
  That means a lot to me.
  And I really appreciate that.
  I sat there the whole time knowing.
  I didn't see it, but just knowing because Grace had.
  That was that was quite a way for her to try to carry.
  And it's also pretty heavy to be the person experiencing that for 23 years.
  I don't doubt that.
  And that's what I want to hear.
  And if you say I can, I can, I can share a sentence with you that I just, I'll just say this and be done.
  Okay.
  Let's do that and love each other and maintain a relationship.
  And, and, and who knows, maybe there's enough comfort to say.
  That I want to tell you a little more.
  Okay.
  You know, we can have differing opinions and love each other.
  We can have differing understanding and perspectives of the world.
  We do.
  And we love each other.
  Yeah.
  I.
  All I'm asking for is one lunch with me and my girlfriend, who I consider family.
  I understand if you don't because she's not your girlfriend.
  But, like, I don't know anything you can say to me, you can say to her anything I can say to anything I want to say to you she can hear.
  Like, there's, if she could read my mind, that'd be okay.
  There's nothing I've got to hide.
  But.
  Yeah.
  Okay.
  Just.
  Okay.
  I'll, I'll think of that.
  I just, I just, I just don't know that I'm ready to do that.
  Because I don't.
  I am not going to feel free in that.
  So I will be restricted in that meeting because there's another party there who is not my family who I don't know very well.
  I mean, we just don't know.
  So are you saying that I should make you comfortable at the expense of you making me comfortable or are you saying we can find the compromise.
  I'm just trying to put it in perspective.
  You're trying to say, I want to meet with you.
  I want you to be comfortable with me.
  I want you to be comfortable with Shaine.
  I want you to be comfortable with Shaine.
  I want you to be comfortable with Shaine.
  I'm going to marry her one day.
  She is my family.
  Like.
  I don't, I don't know.
  We both seem to have opposite desires for talking to each other about this.
  And I don't know how to make us both comfortable.
  So your ultimatum is that if I'm to meet with you, she's got to be there.
  I mean, that's a change in the way that we meet.
  So your ultimatum and then my.
  My ultimatum is for me to lay my cards on the table for me to tell you my story.
  She's got to be there the first time.
  We can we can meet afterwards as many times as you want without her there.
  We can talk about whatever without her there.
  The first time I tell my story.
